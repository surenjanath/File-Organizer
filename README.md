# File-Organizer
--------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Here's another python application I've done.  
This organizing goes into the core of folders and moves the files outside into a designated folder. 
Say you have a phone backup folder with alot of files and folders and you aren't feeling to go through all of it, but say no more. 
This app/code will get all the files and place them into the folders.   
To convert python files to executable file  
use the website :   https://mborgerson.com/creating-an-executable-from-a-python-script/  

I will provide both code and exe files incase you don't have python. 
Just run the executable file and point to the directory. 
Use CTRL V to paste the code into the console.
